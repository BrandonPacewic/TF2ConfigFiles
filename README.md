# TF2 Custom Config Files

My personal team fortress 2 game config files.

## Small Notes

- Keybinds are configured for the Davorak keyboard layout.
- Some class binds are changed completely (See engineer.cfg and spy.cfg).
- Game launch options:

```Text
+exec autoexec.cfg -noipx -novid -nocrashdialog -nojoy -noborder +mat_forcehardwaresync 0 -useforcedmparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd -fullscreen
```

## Installing

1. Dowload the custom files zip [here](https://github.com/BrandonPacewic/TF2ConfigFiles/releases/tag/v1.0).

2. Merge the `tf` folder into your own `tf` game folder. 

3. Add the `+exec autoexec.cfg` line to your game launch options.

4. That's it! Enjoy my custom config files.
